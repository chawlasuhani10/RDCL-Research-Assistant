# RDCL-Research-Assistant
I am a Research Assistant to Melisa Akana, a post doctoral student at Reasoning Decision Making and Computational Laboratory, UMass Amherst.
This is a place where I document my progress for the same. 

Currently: continuing to review research in the relevant area and developing framework for independent study next semester. The study would be a re-implemntation, optimization and extension of the presentation I gave at the end of Fall 2022. Find the presentation uploaded in the repository.

# RDCLL-Research-Assistant
### RDCL- Reasoning, Decision-Making, Computational Modeling Laboratory 
I am a Research Assistant to Melisa Akana, a post doctoral student at Reasoning Decision Making and Computational Laboratory, UMass Amherst.
This is a place where I document my progress for the same. 

Currently: continuing to analyse research papers in the relevant area and developing framework for independent study with professor Andrew Cohen next semester. The study would be a re-implemntation, optimization and extension of the presentation I gave at the end of Fall 2022. Find the presentation uploaded in the repository.
